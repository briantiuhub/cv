  <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p>I'm happy to learn about programming! </p>
  <p>I will be learning about programming and I am extremely excited about it because it seems so fun. I want to create my own trading robot actually. I want to get a better paying and more satisfying job that will make use of my potentials. I have
    been reading a lot of books in regards to how to succeed and how to have a better path in finding a job. I learned that in order to find a good job you must have a good and valuable skill to offer to the world. So how to have good skills? Well,
    we must practice deliberately everyday and be consistant with our routines. This is our craft this is what we do. The learning never stops. We must do this until we die.</p>
